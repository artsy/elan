        | Not intended to be a general layout solution, as most grid systems areâ€”but rather provide a way to display
        | thumbnails in grids with regular intervals.
        | There are three variants: 2-up, 3-up, and 4-up.
        | All grids are percentage based and the grid container element does not have any inherent width.
        | They have fixed width margins that are responsive with a breakpoint at 1024px that cuts the margin in half.
        | Grid containers can have the class
        code .is-flush
        | applied to get rid of all the margins.
